Scientists have known that depriving adult mice of vision can increase the sensitivity of individual neurons (神经元) in the part of the brain devoted to hearing. New research from biologists at the University of Maryland **(26) ___** that sight deprivation also changes the way brain cells **(27) ___** with one another, shifting the mice’s sensitivity to different frequencies.


“This study **(28) ___** what we are learning about how manipulating vision can have a **(29) ___** effect on the ability of an animal to hear long after the window for auditory (听觉的) learning was thought to have **(30) ___**,” said Patrick Kanold, senior author of the study.


It was once thought that the sensory regions of the brain were not **(31) ___** after a critical period in childhood. This is why children learn languages much more **(32) ___** than adults. Kanold’s earlier research disproved this idea by showing that depriving adult mice of vision for a short period increased the sensitivity of individual neurons in the auditory cortex (皮质), which is devoted to hearing.


Young brains wire themselves according to the sounds they hear frequently, assigning areas of the auditory cortex to **(33) ___** frequencies based on what they are used to hearing. The researchers found that, in adult mice, a week in the dark also changed the **(34) ___** of space to different frequencies.


“We don’t know why we are seeing these patterns,” Kanold said. “We **(35) ___** that it may have to do with what the mice are paying attention to while they are in the dark.”

Scientists have long understood that sensory deprivation can trigger compensatory changes in the brain. While prior studies demonstrated that blinding adult mice enhances neuronal sensitivity in auditory regions, recent research from Johns Hopkins University **(26) ______** a more profound phenomenon: temporary hearing loss remodels how visual neurons process spatial information.  


The study, published in _Nature Neuroscience_, exposed adult mice to continuous white noise for seven days. Subsequent brain scans **(27) ______** that neurons in the visual cortex—typically unresponsive to sound—began processing auditory signals. "This cross-modal plasticity **(28) ______** the traditional view that sensory cortices operate in strict isolation after critical developmental periods," said lead researcher Dr. Elena Rossi.  


Historically, neuroscientists believed cortical specialization became **(29) ______** in adulthood. However, Rossi's team discovered that auditory deprivation forces the visual cortex to adapt by repurposing dormant neural circuits. Mice subjected to white noise **(30) ______** improved visual motion detection, suggesting their brains compensated for lost auditory input by **(31) ______** visual processing efficiency.  


The mechanism involves suppressed inhibitory neurotransmitters, allowing auditory pathways to activate visual regions. "We observed a 40% reduction in GABAergic activity," Rossi noted. "This **(32) ______** a biological opportunity for cross-sensory adaptation."  


Interestingly, the changes were reversible. After restoring normal hearing, the visual cortex gradually **(33) ______** its original function within two weeks. This challenges the notion that adult brain rewiring is **(34) ______** and highlights potential therapeutic applications.  
"By temporarily blocking one sense," Rossi concluded, "we may **(35) ______** latent neural resources to enhance others—a strategy relevant to sensory rehabilitation."

Numerous writers produce masterpieces well into their 70s and beyond. Such** **27 __** **accomplishments highlight an important point. Our capacity to speak, write and learn new vocabulary does not seem to** **28 __** **with age. Our eyesight may dim and our recall may weaken, but, by comparison, our ability to produce and to** **29 __** **language is well preserved into older adulthood.


Indeed, the latest research that has emerged on language and aging shows that language mastery is a** **30 __** **that we begin as infants and continue on for the rest of our lives. Some aspects of our language abilities, such as our knowledge of word meanings,** **31 __** **improve during middle and late adulthood. One study, for example, found that adults over sixty had an average vocabulary size of over 21,000 words. The researchers also studied a** **32 __** **of college students and found that their average vocabulary contained** **33 __** **16,000 words. In another study, older adults, with an average age of 75,** **34 __** **better than participants in their youth or middle years on tasks that required them to determine the meaning of words. Thus, language seems to be a skill that, contrary to what many might** **35 __**, **does not weaken with age.

### 第五篇

A team of researchers led by Priyanka Joshi examined the degree to which men and women relied on “communicative abstraction” to verbally convey their ideas and emotions.


Communicative abstraction, according to the researchers, reflects the tendency of people to use “abstract speech that focuses on the broader picture and **26 ___** purpose of action rather than concrete speech focusing on details and the means of **27 ___** action.”  


Interestingly, they found that men were far more likely to speak in the abstract than were women.


To arrive at this **28 ___**, the researchers examined the linguistic patterns of men and women in over 600,000 blog posts written on websites.  


To do this, the researchers computed abstractness ratings for **29 ___** 40,000 commonly used words in the English language.


Words considered to be concrete could be easily visualized, such as “table” or “chair”. Words that were more **30 ___** to visualize, for example, “justice” or “morality” were considered to be more abstract.  


They found that men used **31 ___** more abstract language in their blog posts.


What is the **32 ___** of this effect?  


The researchers suggest that power differences between the genders — that is, men having more power in society — might be a key determinant.  


For instance, in a follow-up study conducted with a sample of 300 students, the researchers **33 ___** power dynamics in an interpersonal setting to see if this would influence communicative abstraction.  


They found that participants in a high-power interviewer role were more likely to give abstract descriptions of behaviors than were participants in a low-power interviewee role. 


This suggests that communicating more abstractly does not reflect a **34 ___** tendency of men or women but rather **35 ___** within specific contexts.


A. approximately
B. attaining
C. conclusion
D. difficult
E. emerges
F. fixed
G. ignored
H. legally
I. manipulated
J. recommended
K. refraining
L. signals
M. significantly
N. source
O. ultimat

### 第一篇

As a university student, I’ve come to realise just how little I know about money. I’ve come to the brutal  
realisation that Australia’s youth are being done a great disservice by not receiving any consistent financial  
education.  

Diving headfirst into the crash course of starting university, I’ve quickly tried to get myself up to speed  
with the financial terms of the modern era to help manage my personal finances.  

I’ve read some financial education books, done some online learning, and have spoken to my nearest and  
dearest for their pearls of financial wisdom.  

There are undoubtedly hundreds of great resources out there for those wishing to improve their financial  
literacy, but while I was researching, I still kept wishing that I didn’t have to play catch-up with the money  
world. I felt that I was sailing the financial seas with no skills and no life jacket!  

However, after talking to my friends who felt the same, I quickly realised that it wasn’t my ignorance but  
the lack of financial education in our schooling system that is leaving high schoolers seriously behind in the  
modern world of money.  

Let’s compare a theoretical financial education subject to the standard compulsory English class. On  
average, English may not be the most popular subject, but it’s consistently on the schedule throughout high  
school, with all students graduating fluent in English.  

A financial education subject should do just the same. It shouldn’t be just a one-day event but a course  
integrated throughout the whole of high school that would allow students to gradually expand their financial  
literacy, and would prevent the need for a ‘catch up’ phase once we’re out on our own after graduation.  

In the same way that learning a language or new skills takes time, building financial skills requires  
practice and years to gradually accumulate bits and pieces of knowledge.

Giving young people the opportunity to become familiar with the world of money would provide them  
with a great advantage to enter adulthood with confidence and security so that they are able to manage their  
own money and look after themselves

As a university student, I used to believe that staying up late to finish assignments or to hang out with friends was just part of student life. However, over time, I began to notice how tired and unproductive I felt during the day. This made me realise how important sleep really is.

Many students don’t take sleep seriously. They think that skipping a few hours of rest won’t matter. But according to sleep experts, young adults need at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep every night to stay healthy. Poor sleep habits can lead to low concentration, memory problems, and even anxiety or depression.

At first, I tried to fix the problem by sleeping in on weekends. But this didn’t help much. I still felt tired and often had trouble waking up for morning classes. That’s when I learned that having a regular sleep schedule is more important than just catching up on lost sleep.

I also made changes to my daily routine. I stopped drinking coffee late in the evening, put away my phone before bed, and tried to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. These small changes helped me sleep better and feel more energetic.

University life is busy, and it’s easy to put sleep last on the list. But if students understand the value of good sleep, they can improve both their academic performance and overall well-being. Sleep should not be seen as a luxury—it’s a basic need.

As a freshman majoring in economics, I initially presumed my academic training would naturally encompass personal finance. Yet my first encounter with student loans swiftly dismantled this illusion. The reality is stark: young adults are launched into a complex financial ecosystem armed with little more than arithmetic and vague notions of "saving money"—a pedagogical failure bordering on societal negligence.

Comparative international data from the OECD reveals a disturbing pattern: nations mandating financial literacy programs (_e.g._, Australia, Canada) exhibit 30% higher youth savings rates and 45% lower credit default rates among 18–25-year-olds. Conversely, in countries where such education remains elective (_e.g._, UK, US), surveys show 68% of university students cannot define compound interest, while 79% fail to distinguish between debit and credit products. This competence chasm manifests in tangible crises—soaring student debt delinquency, predatory loan victimization, and chronic retirement savings shortfalls.

The solution lies not in isolated workshops but in _progressive curricular integration_. Imagine if financial concepts were scaffolded across grade levels: primary pupils mastering needs-vs-wants through classroom economies; middle schoolers simulating stock market investments with virtual portfolios; high school seniors analyzing tax filings or comparing mortgage structures. Such systematic exposure transforms abstract principles into lived competencies. Crucially, this approach mirrors language acquisition—both require continuous reinforcement and contextual application to foster genuine fluency.

Critics may argue that financial landscapes evolve rapidly, rendering curricula obsolete. However, core principles—budgeting, risk assessment, opportunity cost—remain universal. Finland's pioneering program (2010–present) demonstrates adaptability: by focusing on decision-making frameworks rather than specific products, students develop transferable analytical skills. Post-graduation tracking shows participants make 27% fewer impulsive purchases and demonstrate 3x higher investment participation than peers.

Ultimately, financial literacy transcends individual benefit; it is foundational to economic resilience. When young citizens understand debt mechanics, inflation buffers, and asset diversification, they contribute to systemic stability. The cost of inaction? A generation navigating economic storms without navigational charts—a burden both personal and collective.

Chocolates save us from many things, especially emotional distress. They comfort us in times of trouble,  
calming down a racing heart by channelling happy calories inside us. We all have faith in chocolates to  
delight us in an instant!  

Recently, chocolate lovers were heartbroken as scientists claimed that they can become extinct by 2050! But hey, we have some happy news for you. Scientists can still help save chocolates from dying out! If you are not aware as to why scientists made the statement about the death of this wonderful thing, let us tell you the facts. Chocolate trees, whose seeds are used to make chocolate, grow in the tropical plant world and require very specific weather conditions to prosper.  

Now, fifty percent of the world’s cocoa (可可) beans come from two countries in West Africa: Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. Scientists believe that both of these countries will experience a 3.8 °F temperature increase by 2050 due to global warming, endangering the cacao (可可树) farms in the rainforests. These farms will then have to be shifted to cooler mountainous areas, which are the natural habitat of wildlife. This will lead to some tough decisions: whether to grow chocolate or save wildlife.  

Unfortunately, the crisis of global warming has already had a serious negative impact on cacao farms’yields, leading to the prices of chocolates skyrocketing. 

Scientists, however, are trying to find a long-term and eco-friendly solution to this problem! They are trying to modify the species with a gene-editing technology, which will transform the seedlings into a species that survives even in a drier and warmer climate.  

According to a report by The Business Insider, in the University of California’s new bio-sciences building, tiny green cacao seedlings are lined up in refrigerated greenhouses for a new experiment by using a technology called CRISPR. By manipulating the DNA of plants, this technology is already being used across the world to make plants tougher and cheaper. Similarly, in this unconventional experiment, scientists will make tiny, precise changes to the DNA of the seedlings to make the cocoa crops survive in warmer and drier climates

The weakening of the human connection to nature might be good for economic growth but is bad for people. A tipping point was reached in 2020 when human-made materials — such as steel, concrete and plastic — were found to weigh more than all life on Earth. Continuing to grow concrete forests rather than real ones is shortsighted. Simply being in the nearest wood has such health benefits that the Woodland Trust successfully lobbied for it to be prescribed by doctors.  

Yet slipping from popular culture is the wonder and beauty of the natural world. For every three nature-related words in hit songs of the 1950s, researchers found, there was only slightly more than one 50 years later. It is not a moment too soon that teenagers will be able to take a natural history test, given that for decades children have been able to name more video game characters than wildlife species. 

Part of remedying this social disease would be for parliament to pass a “right to grow” law, allowing anyone to turn underused public spaces into vegetable and fruit gardens. The idea is for people to get back in touch with the soil — while producing food sustainably.  

Vegetable planting has a respectable tradition. In April 1649, locals responded to high prices and food shortages by cultivating vegetables on common land in Southern England. The practice of throwing seed bombs to turn vacant plots of land green took off in 1970s New York, and has been revived (使复活) by green-thumbed (有园艺才能的) social media influencers who defy local U.S. regulations in a war on ugly spots in cities.  

Apart from the urgent task of providing more healthy nutrients to those who increasingly can’t afford them, publicly accessible fruit and vegetable gardens connect what we eat to where it comes from — the means of production, if you will. They can make unlovely spaces lovely, and marry use and beauty as well as help promote a sense of community. Plants are also, of course, our first defence against species loss and climate change. Such planting is a small step for humanity — in the right direction.

Lao Zi once said, “Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner.”  

People-pleasing, or seeking self-worth through others’ approval, is unproductive and an exhausting way to go through life. Why do we allow what others think of us to have so much power over how we feel about ourselves? If it’s true that you can’t please all people all of the time, wouldn’t it make sense to stop trying?  

Unfortunately, sense often isn’t driving our behavior. For social beings who desire love and belonging, wanting to be liked, and caring about the effect we have on others, is healthy and allows us to make connections. However, where we get into trouble is when our self-worth is dependent upon whether we win someone’s approval or not.

This need to be liked can be traced back to when we were children and were completely dependent on others to take care of us: Small children are not just learning how to walk and communicate, they are also trying to learn how the world works. We learn about who we are and what is expected of us based on interactions with others, so, to a four-year-old, if Mommy or Daddy doesn’t like him or her, there is the danger that they will abandon them. We need to understand that when we desperately want someone to approve of us, it’s being driven by that little kid part of us that is still terrified of abandonment.  

As you become more capable of providing yourself with the approval you seek, your need for external validation will start to vanish, leaving you stronger, more confident, and yes, happier in your life. Imagine how much time we lose each moment we restrain our authentic selves in an effort to be liked.

If we base our worth on the opinions of others, we cheat ourselves of the power to shape our experiences and embrace life not only for others but also for ourselves, because ultimately, there is no difference. So embrace the cliché (老话) and love yourself as it’s highly doubtful that you’ll regret it

在中国农历中，立秋(Start of Autumn)意味着夏天的结束和秋天的开始。立秋带来的首先是天气的变化，气温逐渐下降。人们看到树叶开始变黄飘落时，知道秋天已经来临，这就是所谓的“一叶知秋”。但此时酷热的天气并未完全结束，高温通常还会持续一段时间，被称为“秋老虎”。立秋对农民意义重大，这时各种秋季作物迅速生长、开始成熟，收获的季节即将到来。

立春 (Start of Spring) 在中国农历中表示春天的开始。立春之后，白天变得更长，天气也愈发温暖，万物开始复苏，大地充满生机。人们常说“一年之计在于春”，农民在这个时节开始播种，为全年的丰收打下基础。中国人早在三千年前就已开始在立春这一天举行庆祝活动。数百年来，迎春一直是民间的重要习俗。在春暖花开的日子里，人们常常外出游玩，欣赏春天的美景


### 第十五篇

冬至(Winter Solstice)是全年白昼最短、黑夜最长的一天，标志着一年中最寒冷时节的开始。冬至过后，气温越来越低，人们的户外活动逐渐减少。农民地里活儿不多，主要忙于灌溉系统的维护和农作物的防冻，同时为来年春天播种做准备。中国人历来很重视冬至，许多地方都把冬至当作一个节日，庆祝方式各地不尽相同。北方人有冬至吃饺子(jiaozi)的习俗，南方人有冬至吃汤圆(tangyuan)的传统。
