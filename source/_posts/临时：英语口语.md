A: I really want to visit Jiuzhaigou Valley. The colorful lakes look so beautiful，It cannot be described in any language Have you seen pictures of them? 

我真的很想去九寨沟看看。那里的彩色湖泊太美了，就像大自然把自己的调色盘洒在山谷之间。你看过那些照片吗？

B: Yes, they’re amazing! But I want to go to the Great Wall. I wonder how long it took to build, spanning centuries and generations. Do you know? 

C: I’m not sure, but it must have been a long time, a testament to human perseverance. I’d love to visit the Sydney Opera House. Its sail-like shape is so uniquely iconic against the harbor. Have you ever seen it in real life? 

A: No, never. Do they have many shows there? I imagine the acoustics must be incredible. 

C: Yes, lots of different shows—opera, ballet, concerts. B, don’t you think it would be cool to watch a concert there, with the city lights reflecting on the water outside? 

B: It sounds great, but I still prefer the Great Wall. I want to walk on its ancient stones and feel the weight of history beneath my feet. What about you, A? Do you still want to go to Jiuzhaigou the most? 

A: Yes! I want to see the beautiful nature there—the misty peaks, the crystal-clear lakes. We should all go to our dream places one day, and maybe share stories of our adventures afterward!

U2

Discuss

A: I think passion for teaching is essential. When teachers are passionate—their eyes lighting up as they share knowledge—students can feel that energy and get inspired to learn. What other qualities do you think are important? 

B: Good communication skills are a must. Teachers need to explain things clearly, whether breaking down complex concepts with analogies or using everyday language so every student can understand. Don't you agree? 

C: Absolutely. And I’d say adaptability matters too. Every student learns differently—some thrive with visual aids, others through hands-on activities—so teachers should adjust their methods like chameleons in a changing classroom ecosystem. 

A: That makes sense. Also, I believe empathy helps build trust with students. When teachers listen to struggles and celebrate small wins, it creates a safe space for growth. How do you feel about this? 

B: I agree. Among these, which one do you think is hardest to develop? 

C: Tough question! Maybe adaptability, since it requires constant learning—staying curious about new teaching tools, researching diverse learning styles, and being brave enough to pivot when something isn’t working. It’s like mastering a never-ending puzzle!

U3

Discuss

A: I think doing a sport you love, like my hiking—trekking through forests or climbing misty mountains—is the best way. If you enjoy it, you’ll keep chasing that thrill of discovery and fresh air. 

B: I agree. For me, swimming regularly—gliding through the water like a fish—helps. Also, taking the stairs instead of the elevator in daily life is an easy way to stay active, one step at a time. Don’t you think so? 

C: Yes, those are great ideas. I cycle to work, feeling the wind in my hair as I weave through the streets, and it keeps me active. Additionally, doing some simple stretching exercises at home every morning—like reaching for the sky or touching my toes—wakes up my body gently. 

A: Stretching is a good one. It’s simple but effective, like a morning hello to your muscles. Do you think group sports can also help? 

B: Absolutely! Playing team sports like basketball with friends—laughing as we chase the ball, high-fiving after a good play—makes exercising fun and keeps you motivated by the group energy. What’s your opinion? 

C: I couldn’t agree more. Plus, it helps build relationships at the same time, turning sweat into shared memories.

U4

Discuss

A: AI boosts efficiency. For example, it can quickly analyze large datasets in business. But it may lead to job losses as it automates certain tasks.

B: AI offers personalized services, like content recommendations on streaming platforms. However, it raises privacy issues due to extensive data collection.

C: AI helps in medical research by processing complex data. Still, it can make errors if the training data is flawed, and lack human judgment.

A: Also, AI - powered chatbots provide quick customer support. But they sometimes can't handle complex or emotional inquiries well.

B: AI aids in traffic management by optimizing routes. On the downside, over - reliance on it could reduce people's problem - solving skills.

C: Finally, AI enables language translation in real - time. But translations may lack cultural context and nuance.

U5

Discuss

A: I think great minds focus on ideas because ideas can change the world. For example, new scientific ideas make progress. But isn’t talking about events also useful?

B: Yes, discussing events helps us learn from what happened. But we should avoid just gossiping about people. Do you think it’s hard to stop that?

C: It can be. But when we talk about people’s achievements, it’s good. Still, we should spend more time sharing ideas. Don’t you agree?

A: Agreed. Sharing ideas leads to better solutions. But events give us the context for those ideas.  do you think people talk too much about unimportant things nowadays?

B: Maybe. Social media makes it easy to spread rumors about people. We should use it to share good ideas instead. What do you think?

C: That’s right. We need to encourage more idea - focused talks. Then we can have more meaningful conversations.
